Feature: Booking API - Restful Booker

  As a consumer of the Booking API
  I want to manage hotel bookings via REST endpoints
  So that I can verify data integrity across all CRUD operations

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated with the Booking API

  @api @smoke
  Scenario: Get all bookings returns a non-empty list
    When I request all bookings
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should contain a list of bookings

  @api @smoke
  Scenario: Create a new booking successfully
    When I create a booking with the following details:
      | firstname    | lastname | totalprice | depositpaid | checkin    | checkout   | additionalneeds |
      | Turkay       | Yildiz   | 250        | true        | 2026-06-01 | 2026-06-07 | Breakfast       |
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should contain the booking id
    And the booking firstname should be "Turkay"
    And the booking lastname should be "Yildiz"

  @api
  Scenario: Get a specific booking by id
    Given a booking exists for "James" "Brown"
    When I get the booking by id

    And the booking lastname should be "Brown"

  @api

      | Anna      | Smith    | 400        | true        | 2026-07-01 | 2026-07-10 | Breakfast & Dinner |
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the booking totalprice should be 400

  @api
  Scenario: Partially update a booking firstname
    Given a booking exists for "Carlos" "Garcia"
    When I partially update the booking firstname to "Carlo"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the booking firstname should be "Carlo"
